------------------------------------
Resource.java will be the parent class
for the other four kinds of materials.
------------------------------------
Book , Journal, CD,DVD 
Each of these classes inherit from Resource. Their constructors call their parent constructor, and set their respective Types correctly: Book.java’s Type is “Book”, Journal.java’s Type is “Journal”, etc. Each class overwrite the toString method, printing out all relevant variables in an easy-to-read way.
